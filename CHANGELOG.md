# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- A release cut without a bump carries the changelog's Unreleased changes as its notes, and is named by the project's name rather than its folder (3bbf872)

## 0.5.0: 2026-10-20

### Added

- The first public release of BuilderBot: a self-hosted workshop for Claude Code, a controller with a dashboard and the machines it enrolls to do the work. Everything it does is in [docs/features.md](https://github.com/aquilaelabs/builderbot/blob/main/docs/features.md); installing it is the [Quick start](https://github.com/aquilaelabs/builderbot#quick-start) and [docs/install.md](https://github.com/aquilaelabs/builderbot/blob/main/docs/install.md).
- The Android app is attached to this release, with its sha256.
- Upgrades from here on are carried forward by the controller, with a backup first: what is supported is under Upgrading in [docs/install.md](https://github.com/aquilaelabs/builderbot/blob/main/docs/install.md#upgrading).
