# The dashboard's design language

The page's visual rules, in one place. Read this before adding or restyling
any surface, and extend the group selectors named here rather than restyling
locally. `test/uniform.mjs` measures most of what follows on every tab and
fails by name; the house rule `design` points here and runs it.

## Colour

Colour comes only from the tokens in `:root`: surfaces `--bg` / `--panel` /
`--sunk` (page, raised box, set-into-the-panel), edge `--line`, text `--ink`
and `--dim`, status `--accent` / `--warn` / `--bad` / `--note`, buttons
`--btn` / `--btn-hi`. Twelve schemes repaint the page by swapping nine of
them, so a hardcoded hex is a spot the schemes cannot reach.

## Shape

8px radius for boxes (cards, panes, modals), 6px for controls (buttons,
fields), 4px for tags, 99px for pills, 50% for dots. Hairlines are
`1px solid var(--line)`.

## Type

`--mono` for data: names, paths, versions, anything a terminal could print.
Three secondary voices: `--f-note` (a quiet explainer, in `var(--dim)`),
`--f-ui` (secondary UI), `--f-tag` (pills and badges). Severity and level
colours agree everywhere: error and high are red, warning and medium yellow,
note and low blue.

## Space

A band of a document surface is inset `var(--row-y) var(--row-x)`, 11px 14px,
and `.field` applies it, so a band is a `.field` rather than a local padding.
A field inside a field does not inset again. The sidebar is denser on
purpose (rows 7px 10px, quiet states 9px 11px); nothing else is. Four
different left edges in one tab is what retyped padding produces.

## Controls

The field skin (ground, edge, radius) is applied to the elements globally,
so a new surface's controls match by existing. What a surface adds is
sizing: full-width 13px mono controls mean joining the `.modal input, …`
sizing group, its 16px phone rule (iOS zooms into anything smaller) and its
`:focus` group. Tap targets are `min-height: var(--tap)`. A row of filters
is `<div class="field histbar">`.

## Document tabs

Reading surfaces, not terminals. A new kind does not write its own chrome: it
calls `docSurface(i, kind)`, which builds the standard skeleton (a
`.doctab.<kind>tab` box capped at `var(--doc-w)`: a filter/actions bar slot,
the band list, a quiet `.fnote` footer) and returns the slots to fill. States
are `.loading` / `.empty` / `.hint.bad` inside the list.

A new tab lands as: its own classic script file beside `index.html`, an entry
in `TABKINDS` there and `TAB_KINDS` in `server.py`, its top-level names in
`test/surface.mjs`, a driver in `test/uniform.mjs`, and a content test beside
its siblings. Renderers run inside `renderGuarded`, so a throwing renderer is
an error band in its own tab, never a dead dashboard.

## Sections and action bars

A long surface is sections: `docSection(kind, id, title, status, body)`, one
fold per concern with its status on the heading, open on a desktop and
closed on a phone. A status is a word or a number, never a sentence.

Every set of two or more text buttons is an action bar (`.actbar`): the
status on its own `.state` line, the buttons after it, sharing the width on a
phone. The destructive verb wears `.danger` and comes last, so nothing safe
sits after something that cannot be undone. A button that started something
wears `busy(btn, verb)` until the repaint replaces it. Icon clusters with no
text are exempt.

## Rows you open

A row with detail behind it is a fold, the shape a bug report has: the name
on the line with its pills, the fields under labels when opened, its action
bar at the foot, and a line divider between rows rather than a box. Rules
and memories on the Briefing tab are this shape too.

## The notebook

Every view opens with the same head row: its one-line summary on the left
and its controls, History where it has one, on the right. That row is the
first band of the view and sits at one height on all six views.

## Words on the screen

One sentence that tells the person what they need to know to act, in their
words. A hint, a state line or an empty state is a line, about 25 words. The
why goes in a code comment, the README or Help, never inline. A stacked row
is `flex-wrap: nowrap`; a long token in it wraps or scrolls inside its own
box, and nothing scrolls the page or the pane sideways on a phone.
